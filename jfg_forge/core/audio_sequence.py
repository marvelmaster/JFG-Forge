"""Decoder for the game's compressed MIDI ("CSeq") sequences.

Format (libultra ``cseq``): a header of sixteen track offsets and a division
(ticks per quarter note), followed by the track streams.  Each event is a
variable-length delta time and a MIDI status/data group; note-on events carry an
extra variable-length duration instead of a separate note-off.  Repeated runs of
bytes are stored as back-references (byte ``0xFE``), and loops are stored as
meta events with an in-stream repeat counter.
